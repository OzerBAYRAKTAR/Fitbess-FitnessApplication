# ðŸ›  Built With 


* [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) (Model - View - ViewModel)) : Software design pattern that is structured to separate program logic and user interface control

* [Dependency Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection) (Dagger Hilt) : Hilt provides a standard way to use DI in your application by providing containers for every Android class in your project and managing their lifecycles automatically. Hilt is built on top of the popular DI library Dagger to benefit from the compile-time correctness, runtime performance, scalability, and Android Studio support that Dagger provides.

* [Room Database](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) : Apps that handle non-trivial amounts of structured data can benefit greatly from persisting that data locally. The most common use case is to cache relevant pieces of data so that when the device cannot access the network, the user can still browse that content while they are offline.

* [Jetpack DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) : Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally.

* [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) : Navigation refers to the interactions that let users navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app.

* [Work Manager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) : WorkManager is the recommended library for persistent work. Scheduled work is guaranteed to execute sometime after its Constraints are met. WorkManager allows observation of work status and the ability to create complex chains of work.

* [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) : A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.

* [Kotlin Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html) : In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value. 

* [Live Data](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) : LiveData is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services. This awareness ensures LiveData only updates app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state.

* [View Pager2](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/viewpager2) : ViewPager2 is a widget in the Android Jetpack library that allows you to create a swipeable user interface for navigating between different fragments or views. It's an improved version of the original ViewPager and comes with several enhancements and new features.

* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) : An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines. 

* [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) : View binding is a feature that makes it easier to write code that interacts with views. Once view binding is enabled in a module, it generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module.
