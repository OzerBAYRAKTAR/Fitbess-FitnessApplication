    <string name="diet_title17">Add Foods Containing Zinc to Your List</string>

    <string name="diet_desc1">Skipping meals invites both weight gain and various ailments. Here are the harms of skipping meals: Increased desire to eat more: While your daily meals could be consumed in smaller portions, skipping a meal leads to increased hunger in the next meal, causing rapid weight gain. Studies show that skipping meals leads to obesity in the long run.</string>
    <string name="diet_desc2">After oxygen, water is the most important element for human life. While a person can survive hunger for weeks, they can only survive without water for a few days. Water is essential for balancing body temperature, maintaining metabolism, and eliminating toxic waste from the body. Therefore, consume 2â€“2.5 liters of water daily.</string>
    <string name="diet_desc3">Processed foods and heavy desserts categorized as junk food contain excessive amounts of fat and energy, leading to weight gain and increased susceptibility to diseases. Therefore, limit the consumption of these foods.</string>
    <string name="diet_desc4">Strive for a varied diet as much as possible. Try to include all food groups (dairy, meat, fruits-vegetables, grains) in your daily meal plan. Even if you can not consume all of these foods in one meal, try to have them in different meals throughout the day.</string>
    <string name="diet_desc5">Long-term and intense caffeine consumption causes physical and mental disorders. It leads to increased acidity, ulcer formation, and decreased calcium levels in the body. It can also cause restlessness, anxiety, mental depression, irritability, and sleep disorders.</string>
    <string name="diet_desc6">Besides calciums role in bone and dental development, it has other crucial functions such as ensuring blood clotting, structuring joints, facilitating muscle contraction, regulating heartbeats, and assisting in nerve system repair.</string>
    <string name="diet_desc7">Experts consider Vitamin C one of the safest and most beneficial nutrients for the body. Its benefits include strengthening the immune system, protecting against cardiovascular diseases, prenatal health issues, eye diseases, and even wrinkles. Studies show that Vitamin C is beneficial for individuals with weakened immune systems due to stress. Since it is one of the fastest-depleted nutrients in the bodies of alcohol consumers, smokers, and obese individuals, it is an important criterion in overall health measurement.</string>
    <string name="diet_desc8">The body needs iron for a series of metabolic processes such as blood formation, oxygen supply to cells, assisting hormone production, enzyme formation, supporting defense against infections, and strengthening the immune system.</string>
    <string name="diet_desc9">Fiber regulates the shape, volume, and frequency of bowel movements by absorbing water. It prevents constipation and supports colon health, thereby helping prevent diseases like colon cancer, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, and irritable bowel syndrome.</string>
    <string name="diet_desc10">Regular exercise strengthens the cardiovascular system, increases good cholesterol, and lowers blood pressure. Being active reduces the risk of heart disease by 50%. (Healthline, 2021) Digestive System: Exercising reduces constipation issues and supports bowel movement regulation.</string>
    <string name="diet_desc11">Maintaining a healthy weight range is crucial to reduce the risk of diseases and to always stay fit and energetic. Pay attention to keeping your Body Mass Index (BMI), body fat percentage, waist circumference, and hip circumference within a healthy range.</string>
    <string name="diet_desc12">There are many reasons not to consume products containing trans fats. One of them is that trans fats increase bad cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) and decrease good cholesterol (HDL), which leads to the accumulation and hardening of arteries. Consuming trans fat-containing foods can lead to serious problems such as heart disease and stroke in the long run. Additionally, it increases the risk of obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes.</string>
    <string name="diet_desc13">Alcohol and cigarettes should not be consumed as they cause many diseases that can lead to fatal consequences. Alcohol and cigarettes are not simple habits, and quitting them can be quite difficult. Therefore, it is beneficial to stay away from alcohol and smoking.</string>
    <string name="diet_desc14">Fruits, one of natures most valuable gifts, not only have colorful appearances and delicious tastes but are also highly beneficial for our health. With the contributions of the nutrients fruits provide to our bodies, we can avoid various illnesses and maintain a healthier and more energetic lifestyle.</string>
    <string name="diet_desc15">Yogurt contains all components of milk that have been metabolized into useful metabolic products by lactic acid bacteria. Especially for people with lactose intolerance, yogurt and similar products can be consumed more comfortably than milk. Lactose intolerance occurs when there is a deficiency in the enzyme that breaks down lactose in the human body. As yogurt converts lactose into lactic acid, it does not pose a problem for those with enzyme deficiencies. The beneficial bacteria produced during yogurt fermentation increase intestinal mobility, help accelerate bowel movements, and remove toxic substances formed in the colon. It also lowers cholesterol levels and maintains blood sugar levels.</string>
    <string name="diet_desc16">Fiber is a plant-based carbohydrate that the body cannot fully break down but provides numerous benefits such as promoting weight loss, lowering blood sugar, and improving heart health by ensuring the intestines function properly. Adults require 22 to 34 grams of fiber daily, depending on age and gender.</string>
    <string name="diet_desc17">Growth and development, immune system function, DNA synthesis, protein synthesis, tissue formation, reproductive function, and neurobehavioral developments are all influenced by zinc. Numerous enzymes require zinc for maximum catalytic activity in biochemical activities.</string>
